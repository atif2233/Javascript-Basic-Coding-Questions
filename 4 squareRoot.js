// write a program to find square root of a number 

// first what is square root 
// The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.  
// The square root of 9 is 3, because 3X3 = 9 

// second what is square 
// The square of a number is the result of multiplying the number by itself. 
// The square of 2 is 2Ã—2 = 4

// find square root of number in javscript 
// there is a built in method Math.sqrt() in javascript to find square root of number 

var a = 9;
console.log(Math.sqrt(a)); // 3 
console.log(Math.sqrt(81)); // 9
console.log(Math.sqrt(26)); // give output in decimal because 26 is not a perfect square therefore it will give accurate value by calculating square root
console.log(Math.sqrt("hello")); // give output NaN -> not a number because alphabet is not consider as number
